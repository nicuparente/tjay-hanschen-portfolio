Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio, should you have any questions, feel free to contact me at [tjayrocket@gmail.com](tjayrocket@gmail.com) - and my resume is available [here](https://github.com/tjayrocket/TJay-Hanschen-Resume/blob/master/README.md).  

Listed below are an example of several projects, all public facing, that I have collaborated on or created on my own.

##[Sparkle-Monkey](http://www.sparklemonkey.space/)  

Sparkle Monkey is a simple concert finder utilizing the Google Maps API, in conjuncture with the TicketMaster API, to easily display the local concerts - as defined by city and date - onto the full page map for easy display.  

The goal of the design of Sparkle Monkey, was to create a full, mobile-first application, utilizing modern day tools like jQuery, Handlebars and Page.js, and deployment via Heroku, to achieve this design.  

Working with a team of other developers, my main source of focus was on the development of the front-end display, to include map styling, original artwork and layout, as well as add the functionality of the calendar to the TicketMaster API and developing the spider-effect on multiple listings on a single resource. I also ensured basic accessibility features for the hard-of-sight by ensuring several map displays (For those with Color-Blindness) and also complete functionality with text readers including Chrome Vox and others.
